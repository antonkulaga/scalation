<b> Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based library for Analytics, Simulation and Optimization. </b>

<p>
This system coded in <a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org"> Scala </a> supports multi-paradigm
simulation modeling including 'dynamics', 'activity', 'event', 'process' and 'state' oriented models.
Scala is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
(see <a href = "feature_matrix.html"> feature matrix </a>)
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.
It also supports optimization and analytics.

<p>
Future directions include adding 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

<p>
Requires: Scala 2.9 and Java 6 or 7

<p>
<h3> Installation Instructions </h3>

<p>
1. Download one of the following two file:

<p>
<a href = "../scalation.tar.gz"> scalation.tar.gz </a>
<br>
<a href = "../scalation.zip"> scalation.zip </a>

<p>
2. Unzip or untar the file:

<p>
> tar xvfz scalation.tar.gz
<br>
> unzip scalation.zip

<p>
3. If necessary re-build the scalation system (it's pre-built):

<p>
> cd scalation
<br>
> scalac Build.scala
<br>
> scala Build

<p>
4. Run examples (e.g., for process oriented):

<p>
> cd examples/process
<br>
> scalac -cp ../../classes -d classes Bank.scala
<br>
> scala -cp ../../classes:classes Bank

<p>
Please read the <a href = LICENSE.html> LICENSE </a> file (an MIT style license).
